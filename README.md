# Anscombe's Quartet Dataset #

Anscombe's Quartet consists of 4 different datasets that are statistically very similar, yet when graphed they look very different. Anscombe created this dataset to highlight how important it is for statisticians to visualise their data in order to demonstrate the significance of outliers on a statistical calculation. He also wanted to disprove the notion of some mathematicians of the time, who  thought that statistics were an accurate reflection of the date, yet graphs are just a rough estimate.

who created it, when it was created, and any speculation you can find regarding how it might have been created.
